# irc-music-generation

Lame title, but that's basically what this is: a bot that reads 
chat in an IRC channel and converts it into music. Basically, 
it's like windchimes, but not.

## Configuration

To get this going, you will need the following things set up:

* FoxDot
* NLTK
* (potentially other stuff I'll include later)

To run the program, you'll need to get FoxDot up and running.
Just follow its [instructions](http://foxdot.org/installation/).

You'll need to go in and edit the `src/bot.py` file to have the 
username, channel, etc that you want. There may or may not be 
much documentation in the file itself explaining how to edit it.
Maybe at some point I'll create a text interface where you can 
launch the file and enter the location and name and such from the 
commandline, but that's not a priority at the moment--the current 
priority is finishing the prototype.

## Wishlist

With any project, there's always more you can do. This one is no 
different. In the section that follows, I'm providing a list of 
some of the features that I immediately want to incorporate, and 
things that I might want to do later.
